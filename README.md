# University Project
A small project created by a group of students at my univeristy.
We were tasked to create a .NET application to manage bookings at a hyperthetical hotel.

# My Thoughts
I've used .NET and C# programming before and it's quite familiar, but this project was quite challanging to create such a big project with people i've never worked with before.
As a group we came together to finish the project (with certain features missing) but we were all pretty happy with it.
